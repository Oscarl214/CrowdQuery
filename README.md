# Crowd Query

## Description

An intuitive and free form creation app for gathering anonymous feedback. Perfect for project administrators and anyone looking to effortlessly gather insights from specific groups. Make informed decisions and drive progress with ease, whether at work or in your community.

## Business Case

The Problem: A family member could not find a resource she could use to send out anonymous forms.
Resources are out there, but most were all paid services.
Google Forms is a free solution, but my sister still faced the issue that participants would shy away from submitting due to the Google Form showcasing their email if they were using Chrome.

Ex:

![GoogleFormView](./client/public/Goole-View.png)

CrowdQuery works to solve that problem as it is completely anonymous and gets rid of the possibility of form recipients shying away from submitting feedback.
